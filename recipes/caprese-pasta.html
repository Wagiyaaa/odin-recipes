    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>1(16 ounce) package fusilli pasta</li>
        <li>1 cup fresh basil leaves</li>
        <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan or Romano cheese</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pint cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the fusilli, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li>Place basil, 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese, pine nuts, and garlic into a blender or food processor; cover and chop to a coarse paste. Add the olive oil in a slow, steady stream. Continue processing until a soft paste has formed. Set pesto aside.</li>
        <li>Combine the cooked pasta, tomatoes, 3 tablespoons Parmesan, mozzarella, and pesto in a large bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Cover bowl, refrigerate to chill for 45 minutes, and serve.</li>
    </ol>
